# Password Manager

This is a simple password manager program implemented in Python using Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI). It
allows users to store website URLs, email addresses, and passwords securely. Additionally, it provides a password
generator feature for creating strong and secure passwords.

## Features

- **Password Generator**: Generates strong and secure passwords using a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.
- **Save Password**: Allows users to save website URLs, email addresses, and passwords securely in a JSON file.
- **Find Password**: Enables users to search for stored passwords by providing the corresponding website URL.
- **User Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter.

## How to Use

1. **Password Generation**:
    - Click on the "Generate Password" button to generate a new secure password.
    - The generated password will be automatically copied to the clipboard.

2. **Saving Passwords**:
    - Enter the website URL, email address, and password in the respective fields.
    - Click on the "Add" button to save the credentials securely.

3. **Finding Passwords**:
    - Enter the website URL for which you want to retrieve the password.
    - Click on the "Search" button to find and display the stored password.

4. **Default Email**:
    - The program provides a default email address. You can modify it as needed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit)
- Pyperclip (Python module for cross-platform clipboard functions)

## Technologies Used

The password manager program is developed using the following technologies:

- **Python 3.x**: The core programming language used for implementing the functionality of the password manager.
- **Tkinter**: Tkinter is the standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit for Python. It is used to create the user interface for the password manager application, allowing for the creation of windows, buttons, labels, entry fields, and other GUI elements.
- **Pyperclip**: Pyperclip is a Python module that provides cross-platform clipboard functionality. It is utilized in the password manager to copy generated passwords to the clipboard, allowing users to easily paste them into other applications or password fields.

These technologies enable the development of a user-friendly and functional password manager application with features such as password generation, storage, and retrieval.
